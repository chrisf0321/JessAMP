                <p><b>Instructions:</b>  The following questions ask about times when you took action and tried to kill yourself (i.e., purposefully hurting yourself with some intent to die).  We realize that people talk about these behaviors in different ways, but we are including <strong><i>any</i></strong> of the following events:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Times when you started to try to kill yourself but then stopped yourself <strong><i>after you had taken some action</i></strong> (e.g., took some pills as part of an overdose but then you stopped yourself from continuing)</li>
                    <li>Times when you started to try to kill yourself, but then someone or something interrupted you <strong><i>after you had taken some action</i></strong> (e.g., started taking some pills as part of an overdose but then someone walked in and stopped your from continuing)</li>
                    <li>Times where you tried to kill yourself and <strong><i>after you had taken some action</i></strong> you called for help (e.g., after you took pills as part of an overdose, you called for help)</li>
                    <li>Times where you tried to kill yourself and no one found you</li>
                </ul>
